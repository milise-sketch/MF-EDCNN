# MF-EDCNN
Multi-Scale Information Fusion-based Enhanced Dual-Channel Convolutional Neural Network for Side-Channel Analysis

To more clearly demonstrate the computational flow and data processing details of the MF-EDCNN model, and to facilitate understanding of its implementation logic, this section presents the workflow of key components of the MF-EDCNN. Here, F denotes the fusion module, C denotes the classification head, L denotes the loss function, and p denotes the final predicted probability distribution.
